# kakashi theme for xaringan

kakashi is a theme for the xaringan R package for making slides. kakashi
has a clean look with color-blind friendly palettes.

Marking text as italics (\*) will turn it blue, bold (\*\*) will turn it
orange, and striking out (~~) will turn it grey.

kakashi copies ideas from many other themes, including metropolis and
lucy, but is ultimately unique. That is why this CSS (copy shinobi
style) is called kakashi, [after the copy
ninja](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kakashi_Hatake).

# will you eventually contribute this theme to xaringan directly?

Yes, when I feel it is done. Iâ€™ve been using it for a while, but I still
feel it needs polishing. In the mean time, you can include it in your
slides using an R Markdown code chunk with the following
code:

``` r
htmltools::includeCSS("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/malcolmbarrett/kakashi/master/kakashi.css")
```
